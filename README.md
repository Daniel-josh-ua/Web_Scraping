As a result of the corona virus crisis, international air travel slowed dramatically, and many nation-imposed travel bans, closed borders, or instituted quarantine periods, international and domestic tourism fell precipitously over a period of weeks. 
Within countries, the virus wreaked havoc on practically every aspect of the hospitality industry.  
Cancelled events, closed hotels, and closed attractions had an immediate effect on other components of the supply chain, including catering and laundry services.
HRS as a travel procurement and management firm offers holistic end-to-end hotel purchasing, booking, and lodging solutions for corporate clients worldwide. HRS automates the process and supplies the consultancyâ€™s finance department with a digitally collected hotel bill.
